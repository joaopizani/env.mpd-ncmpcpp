env.mpd-ncmpcpp
===============

Nice and self-contained configuration for a local-only and/or networked MPD server, along with NCMPCPP client conf.

Some time ago I became tired of the annoyances caused by usual music players, and decided to give
[MPD (Music Player Daemon)](http://www.musicpd.org/) a go.
I knew, however, that having a **good MPD client** would be a key to make the experience not suck.
So after a lot of research, I decided that [NCMPCPP](http://ncmpcpp.rybczak.net/) was my best bet.

Being who I am, I meticulously fine-tuned the settings of both MPD and NCMPCPP in a way which was very convenient to use.
But also, the settings have a **gradient of customizability**, in which _reasonable defaults are present_,
but settings which are more personal are _easy to customize_.

The more personal the setting, the easier it is to override the defaults I coded in.

Enough with background and motivations, let's take a look at what gives this MPD+NCMPCPP its "taste":
